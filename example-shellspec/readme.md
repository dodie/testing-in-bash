# ShellSpec test drive

## Test format

There's a specific DSL built into the framework to support BDD style tests:

```bash
Describe 'lib.sh'
  Include ./lib.sh # include other script

  Describe 'calc()'
    It 'calculates'
      When call calc 1 + 1
      The output should eq 2
    End
  End
End
```

What's really interesting is that despite this DSL, files are simple Bash files. It's possible mix simple
Bash statements and functions with the DSL, so even if the DSL lacks certain features, it's usually not a limitation.

This language looks really neat and extensible, but on the other hand it's something that one have to get used to
in order to write tests efficiently.

Also, some features of this DSL are not on par what's achievable with Bash. For example, [currently it's only possible
to have beforeAll and afterAll functions with Bash snippets](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/issues/7).


## Test Discovery

The test runner considers all files as tests that are in the spec folder and their name contains "spec".
A subset of the tests can also be executed with filters, or it’s even possible to focus on a single test case.

It also expects a specific project structure, and comes with an initializer to generate that.


## Assertions

The framework provide many customizable/combinable assertions via it's DSL, and the failures generated by these assertions
contain all necessary context information.

Assertions can not be used in all places. For example I couldn't use them in after hooks when I wanted to check a post condition
for each test. Althoug I could work around the issue with Bash snippets, it made the tests a bit harder to read.


## Custom assertions

The DSL itself is extensible with custom matchers. Compared with other frameworks where it's simply done by defining a function
it's less straightforward, and has a bit steeper learning curve.

If all else fails Bash functions can be directly called from the tests, and with that custom assertions can be implemented.
However it might have the downside that the basy code has to interface with the DSL, which might be not so convenient,
and the test code will be a mix of DSL and bash. 


## Mocking

Mocking is possible with all [three common techniques](https://github.com/dodie/testing-in-bash/tree/master/mocking):

- alias
- function export
- PATH override


## Activity

⚠️ since 2019
Bit new and unpolished, some features are added/removed e.g. beforeAll
https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/issues/7
✓ has many releases, including a recent ones
⚠️ overall much less popular than bats or shunit2, has less activity issue/pr-wise,
✓ but much less forgotten issues


## Documentation

The project has [detailed examples](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/tree/master/sample/spec) on how to use the framework.
Also, it has a [getting started guide](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec/) and [website](https://shellspec.info/) covering the
basics.

The thing I like the most is the interactive help. Although it's a bit confusing at first what assertions are available in the DSL, the tool helps with interactive help when it encounters an invalid expression.

For example, I got the following error message when I tried to use the non-existent "contain" keyword:

```bash
#"The output should contain 'Total'"

Unknown word 'contain' after should verb. The correct word is one of the following.
            
     be, end, equal, eq, has, include, match, start, satisfy
```
